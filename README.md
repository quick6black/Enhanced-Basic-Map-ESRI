Enhanced-Basic-Map-ESRI
=======================

This is an enhancement to the basic map sample that was included with the ESRI flex API, code added to buffer the GPS point and add a horizontal accuracy circle to the map. The code also reprojects the GPS data to the map coordinate system allowing this code to work in any projection....well most.
